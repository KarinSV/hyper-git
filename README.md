# hyper git

An example site to introduce you to git collaboration.

## Instructions

First up you will need to "fork" this repo so you have your own copy:

- Click the "fork" icon in the top right menu
- Save to your account
- Follow the instructions below

- Break up into teams
- Create a new branch and name it something like `feat/team_name`
- You can start the project with `npm run start`
- Add the names of the people in your team to the `index.html` file by adding a `<h2>` with a team name, and a `<ul>` with your team names
- Make a git commit each time you add a new line of code
- When you are done, push your changes to the repository
- Make a pull request
- You're gonna have git conflicts. Resolve them so your changes and the changes of others are both saved to the repository
- Collaborate with the other teams to see how you can keep everyones changes

When you are finish, you can make a pull request from your own copy of the repo, and Github will redirect you to the original repo and make the connection there.
