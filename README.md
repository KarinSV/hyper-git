# hyper git

An example site to introduce you to git collaboration.

## Instructions

This is a public repo so you can all commit to it. Work through the following steps:

1. Break up into teams
2. Add the names of the people in your team to the `<ul>` one git commit at a time
3. When you are done, push your changes to the repository
4. You're gonna have git conflicts. Resolve them so your changes and the changes of others are both saved to the repository
